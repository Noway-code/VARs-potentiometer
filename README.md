# UCF WEAR Lab - VARs Project

Welcome to the UCF WEAR Lab repository for the VARs (Variable Assistive Robotics) project. This repository contains in-progress and experimental Arduino files for the exoskeleton developed as part of ongoing research.

For more detailed information about the research conducted by the UCF WEAR Lab, please refer to the [Research Showcase](https://mae.ucf.edu/joonpark/research-2/).

To understand the project itself, you can read the corresponding paper titled "[ Variable Resistance Suit (VARS) for Enhancing Resistance Training ](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2022/86281/V007T07A055/1150581)".

## Project Overview

The VARs project aims to develop variable assistive robotics to enhance human performance and aid in rehabilitation efforts. The exoskeleton being developed in this project utilizes Arduino as a key component for control and sensing.

## Contents

This repository contains:

- **Arduino Files**: In-progress and experimental code for controlling the exoskeleton.
- **Documentation**: Any relevant documentation regarding the Arduino code and project setup.
